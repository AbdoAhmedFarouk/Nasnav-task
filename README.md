Nasnav-task

Nasnav task, as I mentioned.
The task asks you not to write or use:
React hooks, React redux.

What I had asked to do:

Should use lazy loading at least at one component.

The only functionality on the site is:
is to make the cart empty when its number is zero; otherwise,Â  make it have the product, and when clicking on the quantity button, increase the quantity.
It's not fully dynamic and responsive, but that's exactly what I have asked it to do. Also, I didn't have an API to work from; I worked with dummy data.
